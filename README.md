# Rolling-Ball
Rolling Ball is a 3D Graphics project, developed using JavaFX library. The project is a game which simulates real world ball motion and elastic collision using 3D graphics.  
The game consists of a arena, a ball which simulates the player and obstacles. Main goal of the game is to gather as many points as possible within limited period of time by gathering coins and bringing the ball to the right hole. Player is able to tilt the arena using arrow keys, which makes the ball moving. Player is also able to move camera by dragging or scrolling mouse and can change the point of view by clicking the "2" key. There are few different balls the player can use, which have different acceleration factor, and few different arenas to play.
